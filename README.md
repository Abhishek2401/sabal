# Getting Started with the Product:
Our basic idea is to provide an online community forum to brings faculties, managements staffs, 
students and parents together at same platform and to increase the transparency and efficiency of the whole system manifold.
# How we plan to approach the problem:
The whole project is based upon GUI, but we are also trying to create online community using webpage.
We are positively inclined towards GUI over webpage as GUI design, the characteristics of the interface are well defined and 
screens appear exactly as specified. In GUI system the data is created and used by known and trusted sources. GUI has better 
sense of context and the restricted navigation paths, also response time is nearly instantaneous. And the most important as
security came in concern, in GUI environment , security and data access can be tightly controlled in proportion to the willingness 
to invest to invest resources and effort .In this GUI first a user would have to sign in or login using his allotted user id 
and password. Now, if the user goes for user login then all the information regarding the students can be viewed such as
students’ fee payment record, students’ attendance record, students’ marks record, academic information, library notices,
class notices, examination notices, hostel notices, notices for events and other miscellaneous notices.
There would also be a section called forum where any student or parent can put up their queries to be answered by the management.
If the user opts for authority login then the user would be allowed to view as well as make changes to the already existing records.
So after logging in as a an authority, the interface would give options to user to view previous records and notices on the 
webpage, to add new user or to make changes to already existing user’s details, to make changes or update in fields like
fee payment record, attendance record, marks record and make new declarations or announcements in fields like academic
information, library notices, class notices, examination notices, hostel notices, notices for events and other
miscellaneous notices.
